# WebP Converter

A lightweight web tool that converts **.webp** images into **.png** and **.jpeg**. formats.

## Why I Built This

* Downloading an image from Google Images often means ending up with a **.webp** file that many apps can’t handle (including Windows).
* Online converters exist, but they usually come with:

  * Paywalls
  * Annoying ads
  * Unnecessary delays
  * Privacy risks, since your files are uploaded to third‑party servers.

This project solves all of those issues by keeping things **local, fast, and free of charge**.

## How It Works

1. Open the webpage (hosted via GitHub Pages).
2. Select a `.webp` image from your device.
3. Choose the desired output format (currently supports conversions to `.png` and `.jpeg`).
4. Download the converted file instantly.

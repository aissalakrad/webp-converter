# WebP Converter

A lightweight web tool that converts **.webp** images into **.png** and **.jpeg**. formats directly on the user’s browser/machine.

## How To Use

1. Open the webpage (hosted via GitHub Pages).
2. Select a `.webp` image from your device.
3. Choose the desired output format (currently supports conversions to `.png` and `.jpeg`).
4. Download the converted file.

## Why I Built This

Downloading an image from Google Images often means ending up with a **.webp** file that many apps can’t handle (including Windows). In addition, online converters exist, but they usually come with:

  * Paywalls
  * Annoying ads
  * Unnecessary delays
  * Privacy risks, since your files uploaded and processed externally.

This tool solves all of those issues by keeping things **fast, local, and free of charge**.
